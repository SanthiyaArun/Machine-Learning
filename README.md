LINEAR REGRESSION :

Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s), meaning that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable(s).

In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, and the relationship between the independent and dependent variables can be represented by a straight line. The goal is to find the best-fitting line that represents the relationship between the variables.

The equation for a simple linear regression model is:

y = b0 + b1 * x

where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, b0 is the y-intercept (the value of y when x = 0), and b1 is the slope of the line (the change in y for a unit change in x).

The goal is to find the values of b0 and b1 that minimize the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. This is usually done using the method of least squares.

Once the coefficients have been estimated, the model can be used to make predictions for new values of x. The accuracy of the model can be assessed using various metrics, such as the coefficient of determination (R-squared) or the root mean squared error (RMSE).
